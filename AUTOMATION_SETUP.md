# Automation Setup Guide

This guide shows how to set up email automation using either Zapier or n8n to automatically process leads when new emails arrive.

## Overview

The automation flow:

1. **Trigger**: New email with "Leads" label arrives in Gmail
2. **Action**: Send email data to Agent Lab API
3. **Processing**: Agent Lab processes the lead through the workflow
4. **Notification**: Results are sent to Slack (optional)

## API Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `POST https://agent-lab-production.up.railway.app/automation/lead`

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "subject": "Email subject line",
  "from": "sender@example.com",
  "body": "Email content"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "runId": "uuid",
  "workflowId": "uuid",
  "message": "Lead processing started successfully"
}
```

## Testing Your Automation

### Test Email Template

Send yourself an email with:

- **To**: Your Gmail address
- **Subject**: "Interested in your product pricing"
- **Body**: "Hi, I'm from Acme Corp and we're interested in learning more about your pricing options. Can you send us a quote?"
- **Label**: "Leads" (apply this label in Gmail)

### Expected Results

1. Email triggers automation
2. Agent Lab processes the lead
3. You see a new run in your dashboard
4. Lead is scored and processed through the workflow
5. Optional: Slack notification sent

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **Gmail not triggering**: Check label is applied correctly
2. **Webhook failing**: Verify API URL and JSON format
3. **No runs created**: Check API logs for errors

#### Debug Steps:

1. Check automation tool logs
2. Verify API endpoint is accessible
3. Test API directly with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://agent-lab-production.up.railway.app/automation/lead \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"subject":"Test","from":"test@example.com","body":"Test email"}'
   ```
